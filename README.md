# it-basic

This is a collection of website starter kits, both ones used in production and ones used for teaching. They share a philosophy of keeping simple things simple.

## Flavors

Each flavor has its own subfolder.

**production-sass**: A SASS-based project that uses absolute paths. This is what I use for production sites.

**ed-basic**: A very simple CSS project that uses relative paths. Includes the jQuery library. I usually use this for teaching.



## License

The kits are available under the MIT License. Some code - notably jQuery and elements taken from HTML5Boilerplate - are the property of other entities.
